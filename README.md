## Features
- Integration with Stripe for secure online payments.
- Built using Next.js for a server-side rendered, SEO-friendly web application.
- Styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI.
- TypeScript for enhanced developer experience and type safety.
- Payment confirmation and error handling.
- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Stripe**: Payment platform to handle secure transactions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript with static types to enhance development.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stripe-nextjs-payment.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd stripe-nextjs-payment
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Stripe secret keys (details provided in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section).

5. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

## Environment Variables

In order to use Stripe, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file and add the following variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_publishable_key_here` and `your_secret_key_here` with your actual Stripe API keys, which you can get from your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).

## How It Works

1. **Payment Form**: Users enter their payment details using the Stripe Payment Element.
2. **Stripe API**: The payment details are securely sent to Stripe for processing.
3. **Success/Error Handling**: After processing, the user receives feedback on whether the payment was successful or if an error occurred.
4. **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience across devices.
